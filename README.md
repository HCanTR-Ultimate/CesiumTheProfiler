# CesiumTheProfiler

CesiumTheProfiler is a modern Windows desktop application for real-time CPU and RAM monitoring, built with WPF and C#.

## Features

- Real-time CPU usage per core and total CPU load.
- Real-time memory usage, including commit, cache, and compressed memory.
- Lists top processes by CPU and RAM usage.
- Modern and responsive UI (enhanced with AI assistance).
- Supports multiple cores and calculates per-process CPU usage accurately.

## AI Assistance

This project was primarily developed by me. AI tools were used to:

- Refactor and modernize UI elements for a better user experience.
- Provide guidance for structuring data-binding and ViewModel classes.
- Suggest improvements for real-time CPU and RAM monitoring code.

All core logic, process data handling, and overall architecture were implemented manually. AI contributions were strictly advisory and supportive, not copy-pasted code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/HCanTR-Ultimate/CesiumTheProfiler
